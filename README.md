## Project Description
Web application developed for the organization of companies or even personal use with their teams and people. Specifically designed for the management of teams related to the technologies used by the company, the website allows the creation of cards with the names of employees, their images, the teams they belong to, and their roles within those teams.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- `Feature 1`: Website entirely developed as a React App
- `Feature 2`: Intuitive interface, adding cards as needed for teams and people through a created form.
- `Feature 3`: Incorporation of button event listeners, automatically responding to requests.

## Project Access
Project requirements:
- Have your preferred IDE installed on your computer.

Have the code on your computer:
- Access the project source code [here](https://github.com/victorhubarb/organo) or download the project [here](https://github.com/victorhubarb/organo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). After one of these steps, and also unzip it on your computer in case of download, open the project in your preferred IDE.

- Clone repository with the following steps:
1. Open the terminal
2. git clone [https://github.com/victorhubarb/organo.git](https://github.com/victorhubarb/organo.git)
3. Press ENTER to create your clone
4. Have your prefered IDE installed in your computer.

Follow the steps below to make use of the React Application:
1. Install Node.js:
	- Before we begin, it's important to have Node.js installed on your system. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be redirected to the website for installation.

2. Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

  - `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

  - `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  - `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  - `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
